NAME
    Task::BeLike::SHARYANTO::Apps - Install modules currently used in all
    SHARYANTO's current applications

VERSION
    version 0.11

DESCRIPTION
    This task will install modules currently used in all my current
    applications. Not included are modules:

    *   already in 5.10 core;

    *   used in development (see Task::BeLike::SHARYANTO::Devel);

    *   required by my very specific applications;

    *   required by my old/obsolete applications;

    The purpose of this distribution is to make it easy to setup an
    environment with all my required/preferred modules. Thus, this
    distribution is probably only useful to me or people who use my
    applications. I apologize if the existence of this distribution on CPAN
    annoys you. In my defense, I am just following a trend started by RJBS,
    so blame him if you want :-)
